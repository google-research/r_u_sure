"""Dual decomposition solver for (packed) state DAGs.

This module implements the dual decomposition algorithm described in Section 3
and Appendix B of our paper. Equivalently, it can be seen as a solver for the
"consistent path problem" discussed in

  Lozano, Leonardo, David Bergman, and J. Cole Smith.
  "On the consistent path problem." Operations Research 68.6 (2020): 1913-1931.
  http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2018/03/6540.pdf

This solver specifically is designed to quickly solve the dual Lagrangian
relaxation of the consistent path problem, a special case of the general
concept of dual decomposition. Specifically, it is a generalization of the
min-marginal averaging approach described in

  Lange, Jan-Hendrik, and Paul Swoboda. "Efficient message passing for 0â€“1 ILPs
  with binary decision diagrams." International Conference on Machine Learning.
  PMLR, 2021.
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00481.pdf

The generalization is that we support categorical state DAGs instead of just
binary decision diagrams. In particular, we allow decisions to be choices over
a small finite set (beyond just 0, 1), and we allow auxiliary edges that exist
"within" a single layer of the BDD that are more efficient to compute (instead
of requiring that there is exactly one arc labeled 0 and one arc labeled 1 from
each node). The finite set restriction can be seen as an implicit set of
indicator variables for each choice, and the auxiliary variables lift our
algorithm to operate on *possibly-ambiguous nondeterministic* decision diagrams.
See Appendix B of our paper for details.

    ILPs with binary decision diagrams." International Conference on Machine
    Learning. PMLR, 2021.
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00481.pdf

  It is also conceptually the same as the "max-marginal averaging" approach
  in Section 6.4 of

    Werner, Tomas, Daniel Prusa, and Tomas Dlask. "Relative interior rule in
    block-coordinate descent." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on
    Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2020.
    https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Werner_Relative_Interior_Rule_in_Block-Coordinate_Descent_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf

  This same algorithm has likely been described in a variety of other settings.

  Note that the proof that this is a valid coordinate ascent step, in
  Section 3.2 and Appendix A.2, actually holds for any set of weights that sums
  to 1, not just 1/|num subproblems|. So we implement a generalization that
  allows the min marginals to be redistributed to subproblems in unequal ways.
  Note that this generalization is also proved to be valid in

    Abbas, Ahmed, and Paul Swoboda. "DOGE-Train: Discrete Optimization on GPU
    with End-to-end Training." arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.11638 (2022).
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11638.pdf

  We also implement a generalization in that we allow more than just binary
  variables. This is handled by treating a single categorical variable (over K
  choices) as a set of K binary indicator variables. However, since we know
  exactly one of these indicator variables will be set, and they will all be
  set simultaneously, we are free to reorder these virtual indicator variables
  on the fly. We thus choose to reorder them to make computation convenient.
  In particular, by first updating penalties for all indicator variables that
  are NOT the best (local) choice for the current variable, we can update them
  in parallel, and by the time we get to the best choice, all subproblems
  already agree.

  Finally, our implementation also supports *nondeterministic* decision
  diagrams, for which there are some edges that do not have decisions, and we
  allow multiple outgoing edges from a node with the same decision. However,
  this is all handled by the PenalizedShortestPrefixSuffixTables implementation,
  and we don't have to explicitly worry about that here; all we need is an
  efficient way to compute min marginals for the sequence of variables.

  Args:
    system_data: Computation-relevant info for the system we are solving.
    variable_index: The variable index to update. Note that, due to the
      prefix/suffix table computations, the efficiency of this update is roughly
      proportional to the difference between `variable_index` in consecutive
      calls.

  Returns:
    Updated dual bound after this iteration, extracted from the min marginals.

  # We then perform block coordinate ascent on the slice u[:, i] for each of

  #
  # How should we divide the penalties up to make them agree on this assignment?
  # We use a variant of min-marginal averaging; intuitively, we assign penalties

  # More specifically, let
  #
  #   L_j(x, u) = f_j(x) + \sum_i u[i]x[i]

  # penalized assignment that assigns indicator `i` to 0 or 1. Note that the
  # difference between these is roughtly how much subproblem `j` "cares" about
  # setting `i` to 0 or 1.
  #
  # We wish to set penalties such that
  #
  #   (m1[j,i] - m0[j,i]) / weight[j] == (m1[j',i] - m0[j',i]) / weight[j']
  #
  # for all j, j', e.g. we want to distribute min marginal preferences such that
  # every subproblem makes the same choice, and the min marginals are
  # distributed proportional to their weight (or, if weights are all 1, that
  # they all have equal preferences).
  #
  # Here we can make use of our prior knowledge that every graph assigns exactly
  # one value to each key. Our packed state DAG solver computes categorical
  # min-marginals instead of indicator min marginals, e.g. it computes
  #
  #   M[j, k, v] = \min_x L_j(x, u) s.t. x[j,(k,v)] = 1, and
  #                                      x[j,(k,v')] = 0 for v' != v
  #
  # where `k` is a key, `v` is a value, and `(k,v) \in I` is an indicator.
  #
  # If we let
  #
  #   vj*  = \argmin_v M[j, k, v]           # (the best value for `k`)
  #   vj*' = \argmin_{v != vj*} M[j, k, v]  # (the second best value)

  #                 | M[j, k, vj*]     if v != vj*
  #
  # Our strategy for making all of the (m1[j,(k,v)] - m0[j,(k,v)]) match is
  # to set
  #
  #   u[j,(k,v)] := u[j,(k,v)] + (
  #       M+[k, v] * weight[j] / (\sum_j weight[j])
  #       - M[j, k, v]
  #   )
  #
  # where M+[k, v] = \sum_j M[j, k, v].
  # This both maintains the sum-to-zero constraint on `u` and ensures that
  # after the update, we have
  #
  #   M[j, k, v] := M+[k, v] * weight[j] / (\sum_j weight[j]).
  #
  # We can then see that the desired property also holds for the indicator
  # representation, because for all `j` we have
  #
  #   vj*  = v*  = \argmin_v M+[k, v]
  #   vj*' = v*' = \argmin_{v != v*} M+[k, v]
  #
  # Note that, for a fixed `k` and `v`, `M+[k,v]` has the same value regardless
  # of the values of `u[j,(k,v)]` across `j`, since the constraint that
  # `\sum_j u[j,(k,v)] = 0` allows us to cancel out all of the terms that
  # mention `(k,v)`. We thus "zero out" all of the `u[j,(k,v)]` when aggregating
  # min marginals, which allows us to simply set
  #
  #   u[j,(k,v)] := (
  #       M+[k, v] * weight[j] / (\sum_j weight[j])
  #       - M[j, k, v]
  #   )
  #
  # in the second step.

  """Heuristic block-coordinate-ascent solver using min marginal averaging.

  This function attempts to maximize the dual Lagrangian objective (the lower
  bound on the true primal objective) with respect to the penalties (a.k.a. the
  Lagrange multipliers or "messages"). It uses `min_marginal_average` to perform
  individual block-coordinate-ascent steps, and uses a set of heuristics to
  determine which variables to average min marginals for in which order.

  The sweep heuristic is designed to take advantage of the structure of the
  min-marginal computations of PenalizedShortestPrefixSuffixTables, which are
  fastest for computing min-marginals for variables that are adjacent to the
  previous variable that we computed min-marginals (and updated penalties) for.
  Thus, the high-level approach is to first process variables in a forward
  direction, then process them in the reverse direction. In other words, if
  there are 5 variables, we might update them in order

      (forward)   (reverse)   (forward)
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, ...

  The solver stops when the dual objective stops improving for an entire pair
  of sweeps, or once a timeout is reached. (I'm not sure whether
  or not this always indicates we have reached a maximum of the dual objective;
  it's possible that the algorithm can get "stuck" in a fixed point, or that
  it isn't even in a fixed point and the messages will eventually lead to a
  decrease.)

    soft_timeout: Maximum time to run a search for. If we have not converged by
      this point, we will exit after the first sweep that exceeds the timeout.

      terminating the search.

  """Partially commits to a primal solution by forbidding bad assignments.

  This function identifies the variable assignments that are known to lead to
  bad solutions (because they have low min marginals), and forbids them. At
  a high level, the idea is to sort variable assignments by their aggregated
  min marginals, then prevent any assignment whose min marginal is too small.

  One complication is that the gaps can change as we iterate through variables.
  If we are not careful, we can end up committing to an infeasible assignment
  (one with infinite cost). To prevent this, we don't threshold based on an
  absolute value, but instead based on how suboptimal they are relative to our
  current best guess about the optimal solution, which we update as we make
  assignments.

  One interesting property to be aware of: For a single subproblem, the
  minimum min-marginal for each variable is equal to the minimum-cost solution
  of that subproblem (since there's at least one choice for every variable that
  attains the minimum cost). However, when we aggregate min marginals over
  subproblems, it is NO LONGER the case that the minimum aggregated min
  marginals are the same for all variables, since each aggregated min marginal
  vector essentially corresponds to constraining a different variable to match
  over the subproblems. All of these are valid bounds for our ultimate primal
  objective, so we take the LARGEST such bound, which will be the most tight.
  Note, however, that if we are already at a stationary point of the
  min-marginal averaging procedure, then all samples agree on all min marginals,
  which DOES imply that the minimum aggregated min marginal is the same for
  all variables. This property may hold at first, but it breaks as soon as we
  start changing the penalties.

  Using a smaller value of `target_commitments_per_variable` and a larger value
  of `gap_strictness` means we fix a smaller number of variables. This
  sometimes leads to better solutions but sometimes leads to worse solutions;
  the largest-gap heuristic may not be a good one for choosing variables in
  general.

  Args:
    system_data: Data for the system to apply penalties to.
    direction: The direction to process the system in.
    target_commitments_per_variable: Target number of assignments to forbid for
      each variable, on average. Can be less than one to only choose a subset of
      variables. Even if greater than one, this function may choose to forbid
      two bad options for a single variable and keep all options possible for
      another variable.
    gap_strictness: How strict to be about the size of the gap. If this is 1, we
      use exactly the gap that would lead to the target number of commitments.
      If this is 0, we will greedily discard ANY assignment that is worse than
      our guess at the optimal solution (e.g. this reduces to `greedy_extract`).
      In general, we throw away values that are farther than `gap_strictness *
      target_gap` away from the optimal solution.
    epsilon: Small value used to determine if floating point values should be
      treated as equal.
    verbose: Whether to print debug messages.

  Returns:
    A status indicator. NEEDS_GREEDY_EXTRACT is returned if the heuristic
    determines that the partial extraction process will be equivalent to greedy
    decoding, allowing actually retrieving the greedy solution.
    MADE_PARTIAL_ASSIGNMENT is returned if the heuristic made progress
    penalizing at least one variable. STUCK is returned if the heuristic didn't
    make any progress; greedy decoding is a good choice in this case as well.
