"""Gated state directed-acyclic-graph abstraction.

A gated state DAG is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes are called states,
and whose edges are "gated" by shared variables that determine which edges
can be used.

Equivalently, it is what we refer to in the paper as a multivalued, ordered,
nondeterministic, weighted decision diagram, which can be reduced to a binary
decision diagram over indicator variables.
