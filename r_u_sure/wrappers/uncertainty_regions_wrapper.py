  """Computes parameters for UncertaintyRegionsWrapper based on precision.

  The UncertaintyRegionsWrapper is configured with on a base penalty for
  low-confidence regions along with a separate penalty for edits. In general,
  the low confidence regions have a smaller penalty for edits, meaning that
  regions with many edits should be placed in low-confidence areas. However,
  it's not obvious what this penalty should be.

  This function identifies penalties such that, if a suggested token is the
  correct length, but has only probability `p` of being the correct actual
  token, then it is optimal to put it in a low-confidence region whenever `p <
  effective_precision`, and optimal to keep it in a high-confidence region
  whenever `p > effective_precision`.

  Args:
    effective_precision: The probability level that is high enough to not show a
      low-confidence region.
    high_confidence_start_editing_cost: The cost for having to start editing
      some characters into high confidence regions. (We don't have penalties for
      the number of characters inserted, to avoid annoying edge cases for rare
      insertions of large numbers of characters.)
    low_confidence_edit_sensitivity: Relative cost (between 0 and 1) of edits in
      low-confidence regions, compared to edits in high-confidence regions. If
      this is 0, edits are free in low-confidence regions, but those regions
      have large fixed penalties regardless of the ground truth. A value of
      exactly 0 may lead to spurious empty edits (e.g. we start an edit but
      don't edit anything). If this is close to 1, edits cost almost the same as
      in high-confidence regions, and the fixed penalties for low-confidence
      regions are smaller. When exactly 1, there is no difference between high
      and low confidence regions. Values too close to 1 may be unstable.

  Returns:
    Parameters for a character-count utility.
  """
  # Consider a single token of length L in a proposed suggestion, which we can
  # optionally place in a low-confidence region. We will assume that insertion
  # costs are NOT correlated with the length of the insertion, e.g. the per
  # character costs of insertions are zero.
  #
  # There are four relevant situations:
  # * High confidence, correct: We have utility
  #     L * high_conf_match_util
  # * Low confidence, correct: We pay a small penalty for the low-confidence
  #   region and also get a bit less utility:
  #     L * low_conf_match_util - low_conf_region_cost
  # * High confidence, incorrect: We must start editing, then delete the token.
  #     - L * high_conf_delete_cost - high_conf_start_edit_cost
  # * Low confidence, incorrect: We pay a penalty for the low-confidence region,
  #   and also pay for the edits. The total utility is
  #     - L * low_conf_delete_cost - low_conf_start_edit_cost
  #        - low_conf_region_cost
  #
  # To get an effective precision `p`, we want to set all of the costs such that
  # - being correct is always better than being incorrect,
  # - if we have a larger-than-`p` chance of being correct, it's better to use
  #   a high-confidence region,
  # - if we have a smaller-than-`p` chance of being correct, it's better to use
  #   a low-confidence region.
  #
  # We can accomplish this by computing expected utilities conditional on having
  # a probability `p` of being correct, and ensuring these are equal for high
  # and low confidence regions. In other words, we want
  #
  #  p * (L * high_conf_match_util)
  #       + (1-p) * (L * high_conf_delete_cost - high_conf_start_edit_cost)
  #    ==
  #    p * (L * low_conf_match_util)
  #         + (1-p) * (L * low_conf_delete_cost - low_conf_start_edit_cost)
  #        - low_conf_region_cost
  #
  # We want this to be true for all L, which implies that both
  #
  # p * high_conf_match_util + (1-p) * -high_conf_delete_cost
  #   == p * low_conf_match_util + (1-p) * -low_conf_delete_cost
  #
  # (1-p) * -high_conf_start_edit_cost
  #   == (1-p) * -low_conf_start_edit_cost - low_conf_region_cost
  #
  # These are two equations over 7 parameters, so we have five degrees of
  # freedom. We choose to set high_conf_match_util = 1, and
  # high_conf_delete_cost = 1, allow high_conf_start_edit_cost to be configured,
  # and also fix the ratios
  #   (
  #     (low_conf_match_util - (-low_conf_delete_cost))
  #     / (high_conf_match_util - (-high_conf_delete_cost))
  #   ) == low_confidence_edit_sensitivity
  #   (
  #     low_conf_start_edit_cost / high_conf_start_edit_cost
  #   ) == low_confidence_edit_sensitivity
  # These are chosen to make the remaining parameters easy to solve
  # for and well-conditioned for different values of `p`. Here
  # `low_confidence_edit_sensitivity` roughly measures how much easier it is
  # to make edits in low-confidence regions.

  #   p - (1-p) == p * (low_conf_match_util + low_conf_delete_cost)
  #                - low_conf_delete_cost.
  # Since

  # From
  #   (1-p) * -high_conf_start_edit_cost
  #     == (1-p) * -low_conf_start_edit_cost - low_conf_region_cost

  # Observations:
  # - When `low_confidence_edit_sensitivity` is close to 0,
  #   `low_conf_start_edit_cost` becomes close to 0 also,
  #   and the low-confidence region cost adjusts so that it costs as much as the
  #   average cost of maybe-editing in a high-confidence region.
  # - When `low_confidence_edit_sensitivity` is close to 1,
  #   `low_conf_start_edit_cost` becomes close to
  #   `high_confidence_start_editing_cost`,
  #   and `low_conf_region_cost` drops to near 0.
  # - As `p` increases, the cost of a low-cost region decreases, making it more
  #   likely that we will add a low-cost region.
  # - If `high_confidence_start_editing_cost` is zero, so are
  #   `low_conf_start_edit_cost` and `low_conf_region_cost`. This means that
  #   the only relevant terms are the per-character utility of matches and
  #   cost of deletions. (Essentially, this means we ignore discrete editing
