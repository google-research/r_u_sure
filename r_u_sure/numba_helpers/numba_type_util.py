"""Helpers to manipulate Numba's type logic.

`numba.typeof` is used to figure out the type of a value in Numba's type system.
Unfortunately it cannot be used with all types; it fails to infer optional types
passed in as arguments, and it doesn't handle lists properly (assuming they are
homogenous and that the type of the first element is the type of all others).
This can sometimes actually crash the interpreter.

These classes can be used inside `numba.typeof` to infer a better type signature
for an object, by forcing it to infer a particular type.
